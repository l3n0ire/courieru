[Radar](https://radar.io) is the location platform for mobile apps.

## Installation

In an HTML page, include the SDK using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://js.radar.io/v3.0.0-beta.4/radar.min.js" integrity="sha384-NLSzGc8WqjQHUlTze1Rp8e+5cjI0KJ8wyU9W+ClJj/ceW8ZFyyX26axTM2pSKyU0" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

In a web app, install the package from npm, then import the module:

```bash
npm install --save radar-sdk-js
```

```javascript
import Radar from 'radar-sdk-js';
```

The SDK is less than 10 KB minified.

## Usage

### Initialize SDK

To initialize the SDK, call:

```javascript
Radar.initialize(publishableKey);
```

where `publishableKey` is a string containing your Radar publishable API key.

To get a Radar publishable API key, [sign up for a Radar account](https://radar.io).

### Identify user

Until you identify the user, Radar will automatically identify the user by a random UUID "device ID" stored in a cookie.

To identify the user when logged in, call:

```javascript
Radar.setUserId(userId);
```

where `userId` is a stable unique ID string for the user.

To set an optional description for the user, displayed in the dashboard, call:

```javascript
Radar.setDescription(description);
```

where `description` is a string.

You only need to call these functions once, as these settings will be persisted across browser sessions in cookies.

### Foreground tracking

Once you have initialized the SDK, you have identified the user, and the user has granted permissions, you can track the user's location.

The SDK uses the [HTML5 geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) to determine the user's location.

To track the user's location, call:

```javascript
Radar.trackOnce(function(err, { status, location, user, events }) {
  if (!err) {
    // do something with location, user, events
  }
});
```

`error` will be null for a successfull call. Errors thrown by the Radar SDK include:

- `ERROR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: the SDK was not initialized
- `ERROR_PERMISSIONS`: the user has not granted location permissions for the website
- `ERROR_LOCATION`: location services were unavailable, or the location request timed out
- `ERROR_NETWORK`: the network was unavailable, or the network connection timed out
- `ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED`: the publishable API key is invalid
- `ERROR_RATE_LIMIT`: exceeded rate limit of 1 request per second per user or 60 requests per hour per user
- `ERROR_SERVER`: an internal server error occurred
- `ERROR_PARAMETERS`: one or more of the parameters are invalid
- `ERROR_MISSING_CALLBACK`: no callback was provided
